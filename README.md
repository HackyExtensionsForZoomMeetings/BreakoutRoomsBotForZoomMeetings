## Usage (As Attendee)

**These commands only work in the main or root Zoom meeting**. If you're in a breakout room, you can return to the main or root Zoom meeting from a Breakout room by selecting End Meeting in a Breakout Room and selecting Leave Breakout room.

* `!mv <room id>` Move to breakout room ID. List of IDs can be found with `!ls`.
